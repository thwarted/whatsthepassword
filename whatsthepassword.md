##### Abbott
> Alright, now tell me what you want.

##### Costello
> Now look, I'm working in the IT department.  Using UNIX over there.  I gotta know the password.  You know the password?

##### Abbott
> For the root account?

##### Costello
> Yeah.

##### Abbott
> Yeah, I know it.  You know, these days, for security reasons, you can use longer passwords, and they are putting numbers and puncuation in passwords.

##### Costello
> Like what?

##### Abbott
> Like asterisk, or colon.

##### Costello
> Or semicolon.

##### Abbott
> (double-take) Er, certainly.

##### Costello
> So what's the password?

##### Abbott
> Should I tell you here?

##### Costello
> Why not?

##### Abbott
> Okay. the password is not secure.

##### Costello
> That's okay, we'll change it.

##### Abbott
> Why? Is it too hard for you to type?  Too easy for crackers to guess?

##### Costello
> I don't know.

##### Abbott
> Why not?

##### Costello
> You haven't told me the password.

##### Abbott
> It's not secure.

##### Costello
> Then we'll change it.

##### Abbott
> To what?

##### Costello
> Something. Anything. As long as it's secure.

##### Abbott
> But it is secure.

##### Costello
> You just said it was insecure.

##### Abbott
> When did I say that?

##### Costello
> Just now.

##### Abbott
> No I didn't.

##### Costello
> You said the password is not secure.

##### Abbott
> That I did.

##### Costello
> Then we should change it.

##### Abbott
> What's wrong with the password being not secure?

##### Costello
> Other people could break into our system.

##### Abbott
> Well, we wouldn't want them to do that.

##### Costello
> So it's agreed.  It should be changed.

##### Abbott
> To what?

##### Costello
> Something more secure.

##### Abbott
> That's the old password.

##### Costello
> What's the old password?

##### Abbott
> Something more secure.

##### Costello
> Then why was it changed to be not secure?

##### Abbott
> Password aging.

##### Costello
> Password aging is a security measure, correct?

##### Abbott
> Certainly.

##### Costello
> So the password was changed.

##### Abbott
> Naturally.

##### Costello
> And the new password is insecure.

##### Abbott
> No, but if you leak the password, then it will be insecure, yeah.

##### Costello
> But the password is already not secure.

##### Abbott
> You got it.

##### Costello
> (sighs) Let me get this straight.  I'm in charge of creating new accounts.

##### Abbott
> Okay.

##### Costello
> Someone just got hired and they need an account.

##### Abbott
> Of course.

##### Costello
> So I get this call, and I need to login to create an account.  I login as root.

##### Abbott
> To create the account, yes.

##### Costello
> I enter root at the login prompt.

##### Abbott
> Or you could use su.

##### Costello
> Or I could use su.  Nevertheless, I need to enter the password.

##### Abbott
> Exactly.

##### Costello
> So what do I enter for the password.

##### Abbott
> It's not secure.

##### Costello
> The password prompt? I'm at the console.

##### Abbott
> Yes. You can login as root from the console.

##### Costello
> So what do I enter for the password?

##### Abbott
> I told you, the password is not secure.

##### Costello
> Then after I login, I'll change it.

##### Abbott
> If you are going to change the password, you need to tell the other admins.

##### Costello
> Of course.  So I login and change the password to something more secure.

##### Abbott
> Can't do that.

##### Costello
> Why not?

##### Abbott
> The other security measure: password history.

##### Costello
> What's that?

##### Abbott
> Keeps people from changing their password back to their old password when their password ages too much.

##### Costello
> So I'll make the password something more secure.

##### Abbott
> You can't change the password to something more secure, that's the old password.

##### Costello
> What's the old password.

##### Abbott
> Something more secure

##### Costello
> Something more secure than the current password?

##### Abbott
> We tried that, but it's too long.

##### Costello
> But I still can't get a shell prompt.

##### Abbott
> Why not?

##### Costello
> Because you haven't told me the password.

##### Abbott
> I said the password was not secure.

##### Costello
> All I'm trying to do is find out is what the root password is!

##### Abbott
> I know.

##### Costello
> So tell me.

##### Abbott
> Tell you what?

##### Costello
> The root password.

##### Abbott
> I told you.  Wait a minute, which system do you want the root password for?

##### Costello
> The NIS master system.

##### Abbott
> I told you.

##### Costello
> You said the password was insecure.

##### Abbott
> No, I didn't.  I said the password was not secure.

##### Costello
> But it used to be more secure.

##### Abbott
> Well, it used to be something more secure.

##### Costello
> How secure was it?

##### Abbott
> It was pretty secure, until it was leaked out.  Then we changed it to something more secure.

##### Costello
> First, it was pretty secure, then it was something more secure, and now it's not secure?

##### Abbott
> Now that's the first thing you said right.

##### Costello
> I don't even know what I'm talking about! Okay, forget about the NIS master system.  Say I need to change the web server configuration.

##### Abbott
> It's been known to be required.

##### Costello
> So, I need to login to the web server.  What password should I use there.

##### Abbott
> The password for the web server?

##### Costello
> Yes.

##### Abbott
> Right now, it's the same as the password for the NIS master server.

##### Costello
> Two systems with the same password?  That's not secure.

##### Abbott
> Exactly.  That's why we are going to change it.

##### Costello
> Of course.

##### Abbott
> As you were saying, you were going to login to the web server.

##### Costello
> And the password is not secure.

##### Abbott
> Naturally.

##### Costello
> So I'm at the password prompt, and I enter the insecure password.

##### Abbott
> Naturally.

##### Costello
> Which is?

##### Abbott
> Not secure.

##### Costello
> I know that.

##### Abbott
> So now you can reconfigure the web server.

##### Costello
> (shrugs) The web server password is insecure.  When is it going to be changed.

##### Abbott
> Later today.

##### Costello
> So when I come in tommorrow, and login to the web server, I'll need to give it the new password.

##### Abbott
> That's the password for the gateway machine.

##### Costello
> What's the password for the gateway machine?

##### Abbott
> The new password.

##### Costello
> Is it secure?

##### Abbott
> No, it's the new password.

##### Costello
> Passwords that have just been changed are more secure than passwords that have aged, right?

##### Abbott
> Correct, assuming only the proper people know.

##### Costello
> So the password for the NIS master is not secure, the root account on the gateway machine has the new password and the web server password is not secure today.

##### Abbott
> Yes.

##### Costello
> Can't we just install sudo?
